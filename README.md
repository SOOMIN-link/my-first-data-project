# University Timetable Visualization

This is my first personal data project.  
I explored university class schedules to understand classroom usage patterns, instructor workload distribution, and temporal class trends.

While the code was created with assistance from ChatGPT,  
I focused on shaping the questions, cleaning the data myself, and learning how to build an analysis pipeline from scratch.
