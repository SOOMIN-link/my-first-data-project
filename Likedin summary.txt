ðŸ“Œ Project Title
University Timetable Analysis: Visualizing Class Distribution by Day, Room, and Instructor

ðŸ§  Project Summary
I analyzed my universityâ€™s timetable dataset using Python.
Starting from a public PDF listing all courses offered this semester,
I converted the file to Excel, cleaned and structured the data using pandas,
and visualized patterns in class schedules using matplotlib and seaborn.

This project explores which days have the most classes,
which classrooms are used most frequently,
and how teaching responsibilities are distributed across instructors.

ðŸŽ¯ What I learned

I practiced cleaning and organizing messy, semi-structured data.

I learned how to ask meaningful questions and find answers through data.

More importantly, I tried to understand the story behind the numbersâ€”
not just what is happening, but why it might be happening.
